# About Test Warnings and "Ollama errors"

## The "Ollama error: Test error" Messages

When running the tests, you might notice messages like this:

```
[Nest] 19264  - 04/06/2025, 5:51:44 AM   ERROR [LlmService] Ollama error: Test error
[Nest] 19264  - 04/06/2025, 5:51:44 AM   ERROR [LlmService] Error querying LLM:
[Nest] 19264  - 04/06/2025, 5:51:44 AM   ERROR [LlmService] Error: Ollama error: Test error
```

**These are not actual errors.** They are intentionally generated as part of the test suite's error handling tests.

### What's happening:

1. In `test/unit/modules/llm/llm.service.spec.ts`, we have a test case called "should handle errors gracefully" that deliberately mocks the Ollama service to throw an error.
2. The test is verifying that our code properly handles LLM errors by:
   - Logging the error appropriately
   - Propagating the error so the calling code can handle it

### Why this is important:

These tests ensure our application is resilient. In production, if Ollama returns an error (e.g., if the service is down or there's a network issue), our application will handle it gracefully rather than crashing.

## The "Command not allowed" Warnings

Similarly, you might see warnings like:

```
[Stoked] 19264  - 04/06/2025, 5:51:44 AM    WARN Command not allowed: rm -rf /
[Stoked] 19264  - 04/06/2025, 5:51:44 AM    WARN Command not allowed: curl malicious.com
```

### What's happening:

1. In the `LlmService` tests, we have test cases that verify our command validation logic works correctly.
2. The test is checking that potentially dangerous commands like `rm -rf /` (which could delete all files on a system) or `curl malicious.com` (which could download malware) are properly blocked by our validation logic.

### Why this is important:

Since our CLI can execute shell commands, it's critical that we have robust validation to prevent malicious or destructive commands from being executed, especially when these commands might be suggested by an LLM.

## Do The Tests Actually Connect to Ollama?

**No, they do not.** All external dependencies are mocked in the tests.

In `test/unit/modules/llm/llm.service.spec.ts`, you can see how we mock the Ollama library:

```javascript
// Mock external dependencies first
vi.mock('ollama', () => {
  return {
    Ollama: vi.fn(() => ({
      generate: mockOllamaGenerate,
    })),
  };
});
```

The `mockOllamaGenerate` function is just a mock that returns predefined responses or errors depending on the test case. No actual network requests are made to Ollama during tests.

## Summary

The "errors" and "warnings" you see during test runs are actually positive indications that our error handling and security validation are working correctly. These messages show that:

1. The code logs errors appropriately when external services fail
2. The command validation logic correctly blocks potentially dangerous commands
3. Tests are properly covering both happy paths and error cases

If you want to reduce the verbosity of these messages in the test output, we could modify the tests to temporarily silence logs during test execution, but keeping them visible can be helpful when debugging test failures.
